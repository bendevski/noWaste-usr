## Details
A site built to practice authentication using passport, since passport doesn't support multiauth I implemented the login a bit manually. The site itself is one where users can order food from a menu that admins can edit. Admins can look at users orders.

## Setup
Once in directory run
### 'npm install'
### 'npm start'
or the yarn equivalent
